## Chatwolf
Chatwolf is a small bot to play the popular Werewolf game in a group over a videochat.
Until now it only works on Skype, but maybe I will add other chat services.

```
- log in with the Skype account of the Game-master-Account in the program
- select the groupchat, the number of werewolfs and the roles you want
- start the game and play on Skype. 
  You will get all further commands over Skype from the Game-master-Account
  
# Tip:
- if you want to use another Videochat service for the Videocalls, you can do so. 
  Just use Skype to talk to the Game-master-Account.
