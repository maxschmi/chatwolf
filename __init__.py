# ideas to add:
## start_console fixing

# delete villager from the list or add a number of them

# rolls number of times

# listing rolls some are majuscule some minuscule

# calling the villager and amor in night is dump

# ask for kill: with the :

# understand johannas dead command

# waiting time if a dead role gets called, not to unveal her

#better implementation of translation

# do docstring and wiki

# continue_bkp needs to reload sk, maybe get it as an argument
